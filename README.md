# Test
To learn how to use

contains Text 3 since i pulled branch_tree wich was containing the Text3 and repush straight after

To do so checkout into branch_four
$git pull remote1 branch_tree
i execute this line in branch_four and i pull from branch_tree, since the text is in branch_tree is get it in local folder

Then i push to update online
$git push -f remote1 branch_four
Need to -f becaus ei think i create a new file in only repo so it doesn't want
